Flexible Timer Slider

Goal of this programm is to create a slider, which measures time, at first in seconds. But at a defined point in five second steps, at another defined point at 10 second steps, an so on.

Requirements (i work with, but i'm it works with lower versions):
jquery: 1.9.1
jquery-ui 10.3

Configuration:

#Make a copy of the flexible timer slider
testSlider = flexibleTimeSlider;

testSlider.config({
      display: '#time_field', #Id or Class of the Element in which the time is displayed in minutes and seconds (mm:ss)
      switchPoints : [ #Array of points, the time step should change
          { #First switch point. The slider needs at last two switch points
            start: 0, 	#at which VALUE, not second, this part of the slider starts
            step: 1		#how many seconds one step contains
          },
          {
            start: 30,
            step: 5
          }
        ]
      
    });
	
	#Definitions of the jquery-ui-Slider
    $( "#slider" ).slider({ 
      min: 1,
      max: 100,
      value: 25,
      slide: function(){
        var value = $( "#slider" ).slider(  "value" );
		#tanslates the value into time in form of 'mm:ss'
         testSlider.value2time( value ) ;
      }
    });
